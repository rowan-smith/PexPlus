# Common Setups

Ready-made configurations for popular server types. Each setup includes the full command sequence and `permissions.yml` example so you can copy and adapt them.

## Server Types

- [Survival Server](survival-server): standard survival with default, donor, moderator, and admin groups
- [Creative Server](creative-server): world-specific permissions for creative plots and survival lobbies
- [Network Server](network-server): multiple game modes with shared permissions and per-world overrides
- [Rank Ladder](rank-ladder): promotion and demotion system with weighted groups

## Choosing a Setup

| Server Type | Best For |
|-------------|----------|
| Survival | Single-world SMP, vanilla+ servers |
| Creative | Plot-based builders, mixed survival/creative |
| Network | BungeeCord/Velocity proxies, minigame hubs |
| Rank Ladder | Any server with `/promote` and `/demote` |

All setups below use the file backend. If you need SQL or H2, see [Storage Backends](configuration/config/storage) for connection details.
