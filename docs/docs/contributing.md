# Contributing

Contributions to PermissionsExPlus are welcome. This page covers how to get involved.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/rowan-smith/PermissionsExPlus/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Server version and software (Spigot, Paper, Purpur)
   - PermissionsExPlus version
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Console log excerpts (enable debug mode with `/pex toggle debug` first)

## Submitting Code

### Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PermissionsExPlus.git
   ```
3. Open the project in your IDE
4. Maven import and build the project

### Making Changes

1. Create a branch for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
2. Make your changes following the code style below
3. Test your changes on a local server
4. Commit with a clear message describing what you changed
5. Push and open a pull request

### Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions in the file you're editing
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep methods focused, one responsibility per method
- Add Javadoc comments for public API methods
- Use meaningful variable and method names

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Follow the pull request template that appears when opening a PR
- Reference any related issues (e.g. "Fixes #42")
- Make sure the project builds without errors before submitting

## Updating Documentation

Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). If your change adds or modifies user-facing features, update the docs too.

### Running the docs locally

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run start
```

This starts a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload.

### Documentation structure

```text
docs/
  docs/
    getting-started.md
    requirements.md
    configuration/       # config.yml and permissions.yml reference
    commands/            # command reference pages
    guides/              # how-to guides
    common-setups/       # example configurations
    troubleshooting/     # issue-specific help
    contributing.md
```

### Adding or updating pages

1. Create or edit the relevant `.md` file under `docs/docs/`
2. Use frontmatter to set sidebar position and title:
   ```yaml
   ---
   sidebar_position: 1
   ---
   # Page Title
   ```
3. Use Docusaurus admonitions for callouts:
   ```markdown
   :::note
   This is a note.
   :::

   :::caution
   This is a warning.
   :::

   :::tip
   This is a helpful tip.
   :::
   ```
4. Link to other pages using relative paths:
   ```markdown
   [Page Name](other-page)
   [Section](other-page#section-id)
   ```

### Style guide

- Write in second person ("you can..." not "the user can...")
- Keep sentences concise and direct
- Use code blocks for commands, paths, and config examples
- Use tables for structured data (options, comparisons)
- Use admonitions for warnings, notes, and tips
- Test all commands and config examples before publishing

## Building from Source

```bash
mvn clean package
```

The built jar will be in `target/`.
