## Code guidelines

- Match existing code style in the module you are editing
- Keep platform modules thin — permission logic belongs in `permissionsex-core`
- New features go in the modern API (`dev.rono.permissions.api`), not the frozen legacy API
- Add tests for behaviour changes where practical
