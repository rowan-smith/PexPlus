# PermissionsExPlus

PermissionsExPlus is a maintained fork of the original PermissionsEx (PEX) plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers.

The goal of this fork is to keep PermissionsEx usable on modern server environments, preserve the familiar command structure, and continue maintenance for server administrators who still rely on PEX-style permission management.

## Overview

PermissionsExPlus provides a flexible permissions system with support for users, groups, inheritance, prefixes, suffixes, timed permissions, multi-world setups, and promotion ladders.

This fork is based on the original PermissionsEx project and keeps the same core plugin identity and command style where practical.

## Features

- User and group permission management
- Group inheritance and hierarchy support
- Prefix and suffix management
- Timed permissions and timed group membership
- Multi-world permission handling
- Permission ladder promotion and demotion
- Runtime backend inspection and switching
- UUID conversion support
- Debug and reporting tools
- **Kyori Adventure support** - Modern text component API for enhanced messaging

## TODO

The following features and improvements are planned for PermissionsExPlus:

- [x] Add Kyori Adventure support for enhanced text components
- [ ] Update compatibility for newer Bukkit/Spigot/Paper versions
- [ ] Improve reload stability and permission attachment refresh behavior
- [ ] Add better validation and error messages for invalid configuration files
- [ ] Improve tab completion and command usability
- [ ] Add migration helpers for older PermissionsEx data layouts
- [ ] Expand UUID migration and offline player handling
- [ ] Improve backend compatibility and database reliability
- [ ] Add automated tests for core permission resolution logic
- [ ] Clean up legacy code paths and deprecated API usage
- [ ] Add clearer logging and debug output for permission resolution issues
- [ ] Improve documentation and setup examples
- [ ] Add example configurations for common server setups
- [ ] Add CI builds and automated release packaging
- [ ] Investigate a web editor or external management UI
- [ ] Investigate support for modern platform abstractions and future API changes
- [ ] Add click events and hover tooltips to messages

## Why this fork exists

PermissionsEx was widely used, but the original project became unmaintained.

PermissionsExPlus exists to continue that legacy with active fixes, updated compatibility, and a clearer long-term home for the plugin.
